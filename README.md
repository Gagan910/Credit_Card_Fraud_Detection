## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in the financial sector. Fraudulent transactions cause significant financial losses every year. This project aims to detect such fraudulent transactions using various machine learning techniques and improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
